# memory-game

Goal of this project is to create a simple memory-game, in which the player has to guess the pairs having only a certain number of attempts. The main pourpose of this project is return into frontend topics that I've already learned, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and TypeScript. The project is bootstrapped using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and using a dockerized environment created by myself, from this [github repo](https://github.com/ncasteln/vite-boilerplate/).
